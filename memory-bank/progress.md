## 🚀 What's Working Now - PRODUCTION READY CONTAINERIZED

### Complete Containerized Workflow (Verified Working)
1. **Request Reception**: ✅ FastAPI endpoint in container receives optimized JSON requests
2. **Container Resolution**: ✅ Logical service names → actual container names
3. **Enhanced LLM Command Generation**: ✅ Natural language + context → Docker CLI commands via OpenAI
4. **Command Validation**: ✅ Safety checks and Docker command validation
5. **Container-Based Execution**: ✅ Container executes Docker commands on host via socket
6. **Optimized Response Assembly**: ✅ Clean JSON response with essential information

### Live Production Examples with Optimized Schema
```bash
# Working Optimized Request:
POST /execute-docker-command
{
  "source_id": "devops-agent",
  "target_resource": {"name": "market-predictor"},
  "action_request": {
    "intent": "restart the service",
    "context": "High CPU usage detected in monitoring",
    "priority": "HIGH"
  }
}

# Optimized Response:
{
  "request_id": "e4e18458-d681-40bc-9ab5-a43c2503ba01",
  "timestamp_processed_utc": "2025-06-01T19:16:18.412594",
  "overall_status": "COMPLETED_SUCCESS",
  "execution_details": {
    "command": "docker restart market-predictor",
    "execution_result": {
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "exit_code": 0,
      "stdout": "market-predictor\n"
    }
  }
}
```
